19,"COURSE OVERVIEW: Acquiring a deeper understanding of the cardiovascular system and how it functions, students "
20,"practice basic electrocardiograph patient care techniques, applying legal and ethical responsibilities.  Students learn the "
21,"use of medical instrumentation, electrocardiogram theory, identification of and response to mechanical problems, "
22,recognition of cardiac rhythm and response to emergency findings.  
23, 
24,"COURSE OBJECTIVES:  Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to: "
25,1.  Define the key terms associated with electrocardiographs. 
26,2.  Describe the cardiac cycle and the conduction systems that controls the cardiac cycle. 
27,3.  Describe the electrocardiogram. 
28,4.  Maintain equipment for safety and accuracy; identify and eliminate or report interference and 
29,mechanical problems. 
30,5.  Identify the basic equipment and supplies required for electrocardiography. 
31,6.  Demonstrate proper lead placement. 
32,7.  Describe and demonstrate the step-by-step procedure for obtaining an EKG and use 
33,documentation skills to identify electrocardiographs.  
34,8.  Calculate rate and identify rhythms. 
35,9.  Recognize a cardiac emergency as seen on the EKG.

80,ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS: 
81,It is important for the school to be notified when a student is not able to attend class.  It is the student’s responsibility to 
82,inquire about make-up work for both classroom lectures and laboratory sessions.  
83, 
84,Tardiness and/or absence from any part of a class/lab will constitute a partial absence.  A total of three partial absences 
85,will constitute a full absence.  
86, 
87,"For further information on the attendance policy, consult the current edition of the MedVance Institute catalog and "
88,applicable student handbook. 
89, 
90,MAKE-UP WORK: 
91,It is the student’s responsibility to inquire about make-up work for both classroom and laboratory sessions.  The 
92,"instructor will not re-teach material, therefore there is no charge for make-up work.  For information regarding make-up "
93,"work, please consult the current edition of the                   catalog and applicable student handbook.  "
94, 
95,INSTRUCTOR RESPONSIBILITIES: 
96,"1.  At the beginning of each course, the instructor will provide a course syllabus to each student in the class.  "
97,"2.  The instructor will evaluate each student’s participation, assignments, assessments and projects based on the grading "
98,criteria published in the syllabus.  
99,"3.  Accurate records of each student’s attendance and grades will be maintained by the instructor, and retained at the "
100,campus.  Attendance will be reported at the conclusion of each class meetings; course grade averages will be 
101,"reported at the mid-term and final weeks, as a minimum. "
102,4.  Unannounced quizzes and special projects may be given at the instructor’s discretion.
